# Investment Calculator

## Overview

The Investment Calculator is a React-based web application that allows users to estimate the future value of their investments based on various parameters.

## Features

- **Initial Investment**: Enter the starting amount of your investment.
- **Annual Investment**: Add additional investments made on a yearly basis.
- **Expected Return**: Specify the annual rate of return for your investment.
- **Duration**: Define the total period (in years) for which the investment will be held.
- **Results**: View a detailed table showing the year-by-year growth of your investment, including investment value, annual interest, total interest, and invested capital.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for logic and calculations.
- **CSS**: Styling for the user interface.
